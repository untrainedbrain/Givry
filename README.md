A conversational Chatbot doing career guidance for new Software Development workers

Workers and Students new to software development industry often shoot for the highest paid positions out of the gate.

The goal is to hold a dialog with people to help them choose what it is they really want to do with software development employment.

Not everyone who works in software development industry needs to be a developer.
The supply of developers is increasing much more rapidly than the future demands of the industry.
